This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=326

PHP Collection contains 3 files and 2 links:
compiler, ftplugin, script for use with 'keywordprg' and PHP
manual, links to vim dictionaries of PHP functions and prototypes.

I. PHP compiler (cphp.vim)
Requirements:
1. PHP compiled as cgi
2. bash
3. grep compatible tool :help grep
4. standard message error from PHP (it doesn't use debugger) :help
compiler
Help:
:make <file_name> <QUERY_STRING>

II. PHP ftplugin (php.vim)
Inspired by Christopher Swingley I add some things and put it in
ftplugin file.
First part is ``objective'' and contains only important(?) settings. In
second are some useful options commented by default.

III. Bash script for 'keywordprg' option. (phpmanual.sh)
Written by Leszek Krupinski <leszek@php.net> for use with K.
Default settings points to lynx and directory where Mkd8.2 puts
php-manual rpm.

IV. Links. Both dictionaries where created by Leszek Krupinski

Dictionary of PHP prototypes:

Thanks for Doug Kearns, Leszek Krupinski and Christopher Swingley

All faults are only mine.
